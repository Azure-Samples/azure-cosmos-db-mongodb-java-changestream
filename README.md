## Introduction
This is a sample written in JAVA to demonstrate Azure Cosmos DB - Mongo API's ChangeStream functionality.

## WithLease Flag
There is configuration file in this sample at mongostream/src/main/java/com/azure/cosmos/mongostream/config.properties in which there is a property called "withlease" by default it is having yes flag.
Please mention no, if you are not looking for high availability in the consumer process.

## Lease Requirement
Azure Cosmos DB - Mongo APIâ€™s ChangeStream is a great way to keep a tap on changes in source collection.
If you would like to do run the consumer in High Availability mode to make consumer to make it durable.
This is not available Out-Of-The-Box OOTB hence custom code is needed.

## The Solution

* This sample will demonstrate, how to run more than one copy of the same consumer.
* There should be a Master/Slave model for consumers and only one copy of consumer must be consuming the feed from source collection.
* The consumer must maintain the state in database such that slave can keep monitoring.
* Slave can become master as soon as it finds master stops updating the healthcheck.
